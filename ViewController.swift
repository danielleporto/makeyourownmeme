//  This app is used to generate memes. How it worrks is that the user can scroll through the different picture options, which are numbered, and then the user can choose which picture they want in the picker and press the button when they've found the right one. The user can then type in whatever they want their caption to be in the textfield, and hit the bottom button to create their meme.
